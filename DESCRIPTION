Description: The goal of this package is to allow users to robustly
    and quickly grid and quantify sizes of pinned colonies in plate images.
    gitter works by first finding the grid of colonies from a preprocessed image and then locating the bounds of each colony separately.
    It includes several image pre-processing techniques, such
    as autorotation of plates, noise removal, contrast adjustment and image
    resizing.
